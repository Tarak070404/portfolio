HTML Explained
HTML, which stands for HyperText Markup Language, is the fundamental building block of web pages. It provides the structure and content that web browsers use to render a page on your screen. Think of it as the skeleton of a website, defining the layout and organization of information.

Here's a breakdown of what HTML does:

1. Defines the structure:

HTML uses tags to define different elements on a page, such as headings, paragraphs, images, and links. These tags tell the browser how to interpret and display the content.
For example, the p tag defines a paragraph, while the h1 tag defines a heading of the highest level.<hr>

2. Adds meaning to content:

HTML tags can also include attributes that provide additional information about the content, making it more accessible and understandable.
For example, the alt attribute for an image tag provides a description of the image for visually impaired users.<hr>

3. Links content together:

HTML enables hypertext, allowing you to create links between different pages or elements on a single page. This is what makes the web a web!
Clicking on a link tells the browser to navigate to the linked content.<hr>

4. Provides a foundation for other web technologies:

HTML is the foundation for other web technologies, such as CSS and JavaScript.
CSS controls the appearance of HTML elements, while JavaScript adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages.
Here are some key points to remember about HTML:

Easy to learn: HTML is a relatively simple language to learn, even for beginners.
Essential for web development: Whether you want to build simple websites or complex web applications, understanding HTML is essential.
Widely supported: All web browsers understand and interpret HTML, ensuring your website is accessible to everyone.
